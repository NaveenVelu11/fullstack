        <p>The BCCI has invited applications* for the successor to a Rahul Dravid in the position of head coach of the India men's senior national team. Applications must "be submitted by 6pm IST on May 27, 2024," the BCCI said in a statement on Monday. That's the day after the final of IPL 2024. The new coach will be appointed on a three-and-a-half-year term, from July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2027.
            Last year, the BCCI had made the mistake of inviting applications for the head coach only after the incumbent coach's tenure had ended. With not enough time left for the next big assignment, the outgoing coach, Dravid, was convinced to take an extension until the T20 World Cup this June.</p>
